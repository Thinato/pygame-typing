## About
This is a implementation of a typing game, the objective is to not let the words come to the left side by typing them and pressing return. Each word has a score that when you type it is registred below, this score is also used to make the game harder and harder as you progress through.

This project was heavily inspired by [bisqwit's](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/) typing game ([wspeed](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/wspeed/))
